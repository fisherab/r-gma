        This is the user API for R-GMA, a relational implementation of the Grid Monitoring Architecture from the OGF.
        It creates the impression of inserting data into and fetching it from a distributed RDBMS.
       <p>
        
        Assuming you already have access to a VDB then to create a table definition or modify it then create a {@link org.glite.rgma.Schema} object for that VDB.
        
        <p> 
        To publish data create a {@link org.glite.rgma.PrimaryProducer}  and insert data into it.
        
        <p>
        To consume data create a {@link org.glite.rgma.Consumer}  with your query and pop ResultSets from it.
        
        Many calls are able to throw exceptions. These are subclasses of the RGMAException and should be handled as explained below:
        <dl>
        <dt>{@link org.glite.rgma.RGMATemporaryException}</dt><dd>This can be thrown for a number of reasons including network problems. 
        A sensible action is to to try the call again after a short interval.</dd>
        <dt>{@link org.glite.rgma.RGMAPermanentException}</dt><dd>This is for errors such as security, configuration or user errors. 
        The source of the problem should be investigated.</dd> 
        </dl>
