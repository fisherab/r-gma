<h1>R-GMA C++ API</h1>
<p> This is the user API for R-GMA, a relational implementation
of the Grid Monitoring Architecture from the OGF. It creates the
impression of inserting data into and fetching it from a distributed
RDBMS. </p>
<p>Assuming you already have access to a VDB then to create a
table
definition or modify it&nbsp; create a Schema
object for that VDB. </p>
<p> To publish data create a PrimaryProducer and insert
data into it. </p>
<p>To consume data create a Consumer with your
query and pop TupleSets from it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many calls are able to throw
exceptions. These are subclasses of the RGMAException and should be
handled as explained below: </p>
<dl>
<dt>RGMATemporaryException</dt>
<dd>This can be thrown for a number of reasons including
network problems. A sensible action is to to try the call again after a
short interval.</dd>
<dt>PermanentException</dt>
<dd>This is for errors such as&nbsp;configuration or user
errors. The source of the problem should be investigated.</dd>
</dl>

The <a href="../rgma-base/cpp.pdf">R-GMA User
Guide for C++
Programmers</a> is the best starting point for
using this API. Also please see the <a href="html/index.html">autogenerated
documentation</a>.
