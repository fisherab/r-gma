\subsection {Drop Table}
\label{sec:dropTable}

In order to drop a table replace line 8 from the create table example
with:
\begin{verbatim}
rgma.Schema(vdb).dropTable("userTable")
\end{verbatim}
This will remove the table definition from the schema. Within a few
minutes any producer and consumer resources still using the table will
be destroyed.
