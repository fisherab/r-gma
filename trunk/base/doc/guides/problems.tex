\section{Known Problems and Caveats}

\subsection{Known Issues}

\begin{itemize} 

\item The query interval is not fully respected for latest and history queries
resulting in the return of too much data.

\item A view cannot be created in the CLI.

\item VDB authorization rules are not accessible to users.

\item The CLI reports an error if drop table is called for a table that does notexist. This is not consistent with normal R-GMA behaviour.
\end{itemize}
