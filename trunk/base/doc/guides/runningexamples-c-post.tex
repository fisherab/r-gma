To compile the program with gcc you might enter:

\begin{verbatim}
 gcc XXXExample.c -o XXXExample \
       -I$RGMA_HOME/include \
       -L$RGMA_HOME/lib -lglite-rgma-c -lssl
 
\end{verbatim}

Substitute \texttt{XXX} in the above code with the name of the example, i.e.
\texttt{PrimaryProducer} or \texttt{Consumer} etc. You will need to add
\verb!$RGMA_HOME!\texttt{/lib} to \verb!$LD!\texttt{/LIBRARY/PATH} in order to
run the example (to find the shared libraries).
