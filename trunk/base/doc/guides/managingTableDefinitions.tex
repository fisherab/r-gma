\section{Managing Table Definitions}

Creating and dropping of tables may be done with the command line
tool or through the API. We describe here the use of the API.

\subsection{Create Table}
The examples in the following sections all use the table
``userTable''. It is preferable to use a different table name and then
clean up when you have finished trying things out by dropping the
table (\ref{sec:dropTable}). If you do choose to use a
table created by somebody else you will not be allowed to create or
drop that table and unless it has been created with authorization
rules permitting you to read and write to that table you will not get
the behaviour you expect!
