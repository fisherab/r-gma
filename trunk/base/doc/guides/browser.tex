\section{Using the Web to Browse R-GMA Information}

The R-GMA browser can normally be found on R-GMA servers. Its URL
takes the form:

\verb!https://host.domain:8443/R-GMA/!

To access the browser, a suitable client certificate needs to be
imported into the Web Browser.

The R-GMA browser can be used to:
\begin{itemize}
  \item View definitions of available tables in the schema.
  \item View producers that are publishing to a table.
  \item Pose a mediated query on a table.
  \item Pose a query to specific producers of a table.
  \item Publish data to a table.
\end{itemize}
