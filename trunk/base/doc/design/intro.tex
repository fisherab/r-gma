\subsection{Purpose and Structure of this Document}

This document presents the more important aspects of the design for the Information
and Monitoring Services middleware component (R-GMA) where it is not convenient
to use comments in the code. 

The various sections describe different parts of the system.

It is suggested that you read first about the Primary Producer Service
in Section \ref{sec:primaryProducerService} and then from the Request
Management Subsystem in Section \ref{sec:requestManagementSubsystem}
down to and including the Remote Call Subsystem in Section
\ref{sec:remoteCallSubsystem}.
