R-GMA Python API
================

The Relational Grid Monitoring Architecture provides a service for information, 
monitoring and logging in a distributed computing environment.

R-GMA makes all the information appear like one large Relational Database 
that may be queried to find the information required. It consists of Producers 
which publish information into R-GMA, and Consumers which subscribe.
